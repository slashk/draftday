Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake appdoc" to generate API documentation for your models and controllers.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
	1. Create the database and sessions
		# rake db:migrate 

	2. Populate the players
		# mysql DraftDay < db/create_07_players.sql

	3. Populate the teams
		# mysql DraftDay < db/create_teams.sql

	4. Populate the users
		# mysql DraftDay < db/create_users.sql

	5. Populate the picks (retainees)
		# mysql DraftDay < db/create_picks.sql

	6. Seed the draft by going to the setDraft method
		http://localhost:3007/draftadmin/setDraft


BUGS:
	*** FIX IN b21 ***
	1. Drafting a player that does not exist causes an error : Mysql::Error: Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`draftday_development/picks`, CONSTRAINT `fk_picks_players` FOREIGN KEY (`player_id`) REFERENCES `players` (`id`)): INSERT INTO picks (`team_id`, `player_id`, `pick_number`) VALUES(4, 1163, 2)
	**** FIX IN b21 ***
	
	****FIX in b17**** 
	2. Drafted players don't seem to disappear from available players list. This is a problem with the query and creation of :conditions. The correct query is:
	mysql# select * from players LEFT JOIN picks ON players.id=picks.player_id where picks.id is null;
	The LIST, LIVE_SEARCH and SEARCHBYPOS routines need to be refactored. They should probably be merged (or one for HTML and one for AJAX) and use a case statement to construct SQL query.
	****FIX in b17**** 
	
	**** FIX in b21 *****
	3. Fix the "" not found ! bug for searching on playeradmin
	**** FIX in b21 *****
	
	4. If you hit enter in the player live search box, you get an ugly page back. For some reason, the search method will not refresh the page and instead tried to render :partial the _search.

	
RFEs:
	XX 1. need user system for preferences and admin priviledges. I am thinking three levels (peon, draftmaster and superuser)
	XX 2. need toolbar at top for screen choices
	3. need to integrate draftscroller with playeradmin screen
	XX 4. need to add in "special columns"
		personal ranking
		projected stats ?
		depth chart / rotation
	XX 5. would like to tally franchise stats (projected or 2006) at bottom of franchise search
	-- 6. Perhaps add in MLB team stats page ?
	7. Create separate screen for franchise 2007 projected / 2006 actual stats accumulation
	XX 8. make header into partial
	9. rewrite setDraft so that it APPENDS to already created draft instead of trying to write over it
	10. create webpage to config setDraft
	11. Added retention controller. Extend player with "last years team" field. Extend player with "years retained" field. Create model for retainees (team_id, player_id). Let players see all people from last year, then check or move retainees into place. Put date check to lock down.
	
TEST PLAN
	Players
		1. 
		
	Drafts
		1. Create draft, drop draft, recreated draft
		2. draft player, undraft player, redraft player
			draft player check to see he's not in player list
		3.
