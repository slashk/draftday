BUGS:
	1. Drafting a player that does not exist causes an error : Mysql::Error: Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`draftday_development/picks`, CONSTRAINT `fk_picks_players` FOREIGN KEY (`player_id`) REFERENCES `players` (`id`)): INSERT INTO picks (`team_id`, `player_id`, `pick_number`) VALUES(4, 1163, 2)
	
	2. Drafted players don't seem to disappear from available players list. This is a problem with the query and creation of :conditions. The correct query is:
	mysql# select * from players LEFT JOIN picks ON players.id=picks.player_id where picks.id is null;
	The LIST, LIVE_SEARCH and SEARCHBYPOS routines need to be refactored. They should probably be merged (or one for HTML and one for AJAX) and use a case statement to construct SQL query.
